## Deployment

### Manual Deployment

Deploy to production:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Automatic Deployment

Connect your repository to Netlify for automatic deployments on every push to the main branch.

## Security Notes

1. **App Passwords**: Use app-specific passwords for email authentication, not your regular email password
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
3. **CORS**: Only add trusted domains to the `allowedOrigins` array
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: 
   - Verify your email credentials
   - Ensure you're using an app password, not your regular password
   - Check that 2FA is enabled on your email account

2. **CORS errors**:
   - Verify the requesting domain is in the `allowedOrigins` array
   - Check that the request includes proper headers

3. **Function not found**:
   - Ensure the function is deployed correctly
   - Check the Netlify Functions dashboard for deployment status
